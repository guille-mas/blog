**Time to market** and superb **execution** are key for a tech startup to succed on a competitive world.  
An organization's ability to learn from mistakes and pivot quickly enough, can be enabled by their people if they share the right mindset, understand the business, and collaborate together thowards global goals.  

<br/>

As a human oriented full stack developer, inspired by devops principles, I work closely with remote teams to help organizations improve their streams of value, delivering **high quality software** through thoughtful planning, design and implementation of new features, refactor of legacy codebases, automatization of existing workflows, and designing new software development processes.

<br/>

I have been fortunate enough, to work with excellent mentors and friends, who helped me realize that whatever solution I build, it should help my co-workers to excel at what they do best. That attitude drives more value to an organization, than thriving to be a rockstar coder, who writes code that no one understands except by its own author.  

<br/>

I live in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay; A beautiful country in South America that nicely fits into **UTC-3 / EST+1**.  
I live in a **strategic timezone**, which allows me to work remotely with US teams during normal working hours.  
I've a prooven track of +6 years of experience as a remote developer working for distributed global companies, and +13 years of profesional experience.
If you need help setting up a distributed team, I can help you with that too.  

<br/>

I've a significant academic background in computer science and psychology. But most of what I learned about software engineering comes from being an avid self learner.

### Let's talk

If you are looking for a proficient **full-stack developer**, knowleadgable on **devops** techniques, and a **team player** who cares about people and technical culture, please drop me a line. I would love to know about your project.
