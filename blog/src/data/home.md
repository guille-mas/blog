### I know...

Time to market and superb execution are key for a tech startup to thrive on a competitive world. \
That an organization's ability to learn from mistakes and pivot fast enough, can be supercharged by its development team, IF they have the right mindset, understand the business, collaborate together and work efficiently, aligned to global goals. \
Those are valuable truths that I learned while writing software for startups and software factories for more than a decade.
I have been fortunate enough, to work with excellent mentors and friends, who helped me realize that whatever solution I build, it should help my co-workers to excel at what they do best. It's not a competition to win an A-Player/alpha/ninja coder badge, writing code that no one understand except by me. That's not high quality software, neither effective/business-oriented software engineering.

If you are looking for a proficient full-stack developer, knowleadgable on devops techniques, and you consider I share your values, then please drop me a line. I would love to know how I can help you deliver the best product you want to build.

I live in Montevideo, the capital city of Uruguay, in South America.
At UTC-3 ( EST+1 ) I am located in a strategic timezone, which allows me to work remotely with US teams during normal working hours.
