Imagine for a moment that you where hired on a fast paced startup, to work on an important php backend project, along with 5 other developers.
The startup was looking for a fast learner who doesn't need to much hand holding, and can start killing tickets as early as possible.
The first day, your manager assign you the first task; you must set up your development environment. You are able to get your credentials in place after waiting from one of your coworkers to be released from her current task. She is the most knowleadgable person in the room about the technical aspects of the project; every subtle detail, every dependency, every version number, every step to wire up that beast, are spread across the production environment logs, a few txt files on her computer, and a few code comments.
