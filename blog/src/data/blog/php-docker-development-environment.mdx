Welcome to the first post of my blog! Yay! I'm excited!  
Hopefully it will help you achieve a meaningful task that will save countless hours to your development and operations teams.  

If you follow through this first chapter. You will end up with a working PHP 7.4 development environment, and a _production like_ environment. Both easily usable with one simple command, that will ensure everyone in your team it's on the same page regarding the runtime environment of your project.

### Concepts

**DevOps** it's a pretty hypped term these days, and that can produce confusions, but it simply comes down to:  

_A software development metodology, that enable development and operations teams to produce better outcomes for their organization by empowering **collaboration** and **communication** between them_

**Infrastructue as code** it's another term you are going to see a lot here; It was coinned by the DevOps community, and it means:

_The process of managing, provisioning and docummenting every aspect of your infrastructure's life cycles_

Writing your infrastructure as code has several advantages. Some of them are:

- Reduce times of infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Ease bug reproduction
- Communicate in code every relevant aspect of your infrastructure
- Empowers an organization to evolve it's development and operations workflows faster
- Remove human errors from critical tasks
- Removes burocreacy
- Enable technical teams to try new ideas in production like environments without risks
- Developers will have a better understanding of the production environment

More on those later. Now it's time to get our hands dirty.

### Configuration

Docker & docker-compose setup

MakeGNU

### Create a custom Docker image

### Declare your development environment with docker-compose

### Define two different environments: development and production

### Update your development environment

### Upload your images
