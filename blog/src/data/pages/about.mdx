### A walk down Memory Lane

I've been interested in computers since I can remember; Starting to code as a hobby when I was 14 years old.  
I wrote a useful program for my dad with Visual Basic 4 and Microsoft SQLServer, a Geocities website full of GIFs, a few simple games, an assembler program that froze my computer, and a lot of simple programs.
Soon after that, I found out about something called "open-source" and quickly fell in love with the idea.  
Once, after 2 weeks of failed attempts, I was able to install my first Linux distro. It was Red Hat 4.2, and I was 16. 
By then I dreamed about being a hacker. I loved to learn about Linux, white-hat hacking, and read stories about Captain Crunch, Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Linus Torvalds, and other heroes of the cyberpunk culture.
At 18 I thought I needed to widen my point of view about life, so I decided to study psychology at the university. 
But after a few years of coursing those studies, I came back into software development cause I just can't help it; I love to write software, and the creative thinking required to build simple solutions to complex problems.
