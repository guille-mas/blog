Hey there!  
  
I'm a software architect with +13 years of professional experience as a software developer.  
I've been working for startups, in remote distributed teams for the last +7 years of my career.
I've an academic background in CS and psychology. But most of what I learned about software engineering has come from being an avid self learner.  

### A walk down Memory Lane

I've been in love with computers since I can remember; Starting to code as a hobbie when I was 14 years old in Visual Basic 4. I wrote a few useful programs for my dad, and I used to hang out with a friend of mine to learn coding together during endless nights.  
I quickly felt in love with open source technologies and after a few weeks I was able to install my first Linux distro; Red Hat 4.2. I was 16 at that moment, and by then I dreamed about being a hacker. But to be honest I was only able to hack my high school teacher's password, besides a few other silly tricks.  
At 18 I thought I needed to widen my point of view about life, so I made the decision to study psychology. A few years later I decided to get back into software development cause I just can't help it; love to write software.
