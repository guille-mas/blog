Welcome to the first post of my blog! Yay! I'm excited!  
Hopefully it will help you achieve a meaningful task that will save countless hours to your development and operations teams.  

If you follow through this first chapter. You will end up with a working PHP 7.4 development environment, and a _production like_ environment. Both easily usable with one simple command, that will ensure everyone in your team it's on the same page regarding the runtime environment of your project.

### Concepts

Infrastructue as code it's a term coinned by the DevOps community.  

DevOps is a pretty hypped term these days. Which can produce confusions, but it simply comes down to this:  

- Devops:  A software development metodology, that enable development and operations teams to produce better outcomes for their organization by empowering **collaboration** and **communication** between them

- Infrastructure as code: The process of managing, provisioning and docummenting every aspect of your infrastructure's life cycles

Writing your infrastructure as code as several advantages. Some of them are:

- Reduce times of infrastructure setup and maintenance
- Ease bug reproduction
- Communicate in code every relevant aspect of your infrastructure
- Empowers an organization to evolve it's development and operations practices faster and easier
- Remove human errors from critical tasks
- Developers will have a better understanding of the production environment

More on those later. Now it's time to get our hands dirty.
