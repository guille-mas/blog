### I believe that

Time to market and superb execution are key for a tech startup to succed on a competitive world.  
An organization's ability to learn from mistakes and pivot quickly enough, can be enabled by their development and operations teams if they share the right mindset, understand the business, and collaborate together thowards global goals.  
I have been fortunate enough, to work with excellent mentors and friends, who helped me realize that whatever solution I build, it should help my co-workers to excel at what they do best. That attitude drives more value to an organization, than thriving to be a rockstar coder, who writes code that no one understands except by you.  
  
If you are looking for a proficient full-stack developer, knowleadgable on devops techniques, and a team player who cares about people and technical culture, please drop me a line. I would love to know how I can help you deliver the best product you want to build.  
  
### Remote consultancy services

I live in Montevideo, capital city of Uruguay; A beautiful country in South America that nicely fits into UTC-3/EST+1.  
I live in a strategic timezone, which allows me to work remotely with US teams during normal working hours.  
I've a prooven track of more than 6 years of experience as a remote developer working for distributed global companies, and 13+ years of profesional experience.
If you need help setting up a distributed team, I can help you with that too.
